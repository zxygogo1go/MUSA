## Introduction
MUSA is a two-stage deformable image registration framework for head-and-neck CT. It decomposes the complex head-and-neck deformation into a bulk posture change and residual fine deformation by leveraging spatially variant regularization on bony structures and soft tissue. We highlight the importance of explicit multiresolution modeling and anatomical constraints for achieving anatomically plausible deformations.

In the animation above, we linearly scale the deformation field to visualize the "deforming process". This is **NOT** a rigorous way to analyze deformation, because the true transformation is **NOT** guaranteed to be linear.
Nevertheless, it can highlight some aspects of plausibility/implausibility of the entire process.  
For the 1-stage method, we divide the total deformation into 10 evenly spaced steps. For the 2-stage method, we apply the stage 1 and stage 2 deformations sequentially, using 5 steps for each stage (10 steps total). The difference is visible in how the head pitches upward and in the Jacobian determinant maps.

For the expected preprocessed data layout, see [docs/data_format.md](docs/data_format.md).

### Dataset and preprocessing
We cannot share the processed dataset. However, the raw inter-subject datasets used in this study can be obtained from [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/).

The preprocessing steps include the following:
- Background removal: Remove the background, including the scanning bed and patient immobilization devices.
- Standardizing orientation: Reorient all images to follow the convention:  
  - *i*: Right-to-Left (R → L)  
  - *j*: Anterior-to-Posterior (A → P)  
  - *k*: Inferior-to-Superior (I → S)  
- Centering: Rigid alignment to a common template.
- Intensity clippling and normalization: Clip image intensity values to the range [-1024, 3000] Hounsfield Units (HU) and normalize them to the range [0,1].  
- Spatial interpolation and cropping: All images are resampled to an isotropic pixel spacing of 2 mm using trilinear interpolation and then cropped to a matrix size of 160x160x192. The half-resolution images used in the first stage of the two-stage approaches are downsampled to a resolution of 4 mm and a matrix size of 80x80x96.

Segmentation for bony structures and related soft tissue organs at risk (OARs) can be obtained using existing deep learning-based autosegmentation methods, for example:  
- Vertebrae segmentation: [challenge](https://github.com/anjany/verse), [example repo](https://github.com/christianpayer/MedicalDataAugmentationTool-VerSe)  
- Head and Neck (HN) OAR segmentation: [challenge](https://structseg2019.grand-challenge.org/Home/), [example repo](https://github.com/HiLab-git/SepNet)
